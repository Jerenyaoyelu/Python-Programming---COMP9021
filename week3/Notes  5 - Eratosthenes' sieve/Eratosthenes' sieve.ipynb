Three spaces precede the display of the data that are output with __max_size__ minus 1 many characters, if any.

    "To save half of the sieve's space and not have to cross out the proper multiples of 2, one can change __sieve__ and make it a list of length $\\lfloor\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\rfloor$, with indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... meant to refer to the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 9...  The price we pay for this is that we lose the simple equivalence between \"number $p$ is prime\" and \"__sieve__ eventually stores __True__ at index $p$\": the equivalence becomes: \"number $p$ is prime\" iff \"__sieve__ eventually stores __True__ at index $\\lfloor\\frac{p - 1}{2}\\rfloor$\"."

Also, only the proper odd multiples at most equal to $n$ of $p$ have to be crossed out; so after having crossed out such a multiple $a$, the next multiple of $p$ that needs to crossed out (in case it is still at most equal to $n$), is referred to at index $\\frac{a+2p-1}{2}=\\frac{a-1}{2}+p=\\frac{a-1}{2}+2k+1$, so $2k+1$ needs to be added to the index that refers to $a$ to refer to that next multiple of $p$."

    "To display all prime numbers at most equal to $n$ from the list returned by __optimised_sieve_of_primes_up_to()__, we need to adapt the function __sequence_and_max_size_from()__. Essentially, one has to generate all numbers of the form $2i+1$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq\\lfloor\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\rfloor$ such that the list __sieve__ returned by __optimised_sieve_of_primes_up_to()__ has a value of __True__ at index $i$; such is the relationship between the odd prime numbers at most equal to $n$ and the strictly positive indexes in __sieve__. But these odd prime numbers have to be preceded with 2. We still want to return an iterator. The simplest solution is to create an iterator from an iterator meant to generate 2 only, and the generator expression __(2 * p + 1 for p in range(1, len(sieve)) if sieve[p]))__. The __chain()__ function from the __itertools__ module lets us combine a sequence of iterables (some of which can be iterators) into one iterator:"
