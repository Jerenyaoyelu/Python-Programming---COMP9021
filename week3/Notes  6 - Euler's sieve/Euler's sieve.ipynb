    "So though Euler's sieve sounded as a good idea and a possible improvement over Eratosthenes' sieve, it turned out to perform much worse because often applying the __remove()__ method to a list is not efficient: it is on average linear in the length of the list. But applying the __remove()__ method to a set is efficient: it has constant complexity. This suggests to, at every stage when all proper multiples of a (prime) number $p$ have to be eliminated, convert the list of numbers that are still left to a set, remove those multiples from the set, and then convert the resulting set back to a list. Sorting is costly, but being performed only as many times as there are prime numbers smaller than $\\lfloor\\sqrt n\\rfloor$, it could still bring an improvement."

The approach is flawed if numbers are eliminated from __sieve__, but it is valid if numbers are eliminated from a copy of __sieve__ as a set. To demonstrate it, we define a new version of __eliminate_proper_multiples_from_set()__ that makes use of a global declaration, a notion that we now introduce."
